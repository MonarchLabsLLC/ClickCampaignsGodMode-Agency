Welcome to ClickCampaigns God Mode for Agencies! Follow these steps to get your AI marketing team up and running.

## Step 1: Open This Folder

Open this entire folder in **Cursor** or **VS Code**.

- In Cursor: **File → Open Folder** → select this folder
- In VS Code: **File → Open Folder** → select this folder

## Step 2: Launch Claude Code

Open the terminal inside your editor and paste this prompt.

**If the MCP is already connected:**

```
Read the CLAUDE.md file, use the ClickCampaigns MCP, and start my campaign.
```

**If the MCP is NOT connected yet (just paste your token right in):**

```
Read the CLAUDE.md file, use the ClickCampaigns MCP, and start my campaign with this token: cc-paste-your-token-here
```

Replace `cc-paste-your-token-here` with the token from Step 7 of the Campaign Wizard.

That's it! Alex will introduce himself and your team of 22 marketing specialists.

## Step 3: Set Up Your First Client

You'll see an `example-client` folder inside `clients/`. Rename it to your client's name (e.g., `acme-corp`).

For each new client, just create a new folder under `clients/` with the same structure — or ask Alex to do it for you.

Drop your client's brand materials into their folder:
- `clients/your-client/brand-kit/knowledge-base/` — Product info, audience research
- `clients/your-client/brand-kit/style-guide/` — Colors, fonts, logos

## Step 4: Set Up API Keys (Optional but Recommended)

For the best results (AI images, stock photos), add API keys:

1. Find the file called `.env.example` in this folder
2. Make a copy of it and rename the copy to `.env`
3. Open `.env` and paste your API keys:

| Key | What It Does | Where to Get It |
|-----|-------------|-----------------|
| GEMINI_API_KEY | AI-generated images for your marketing assets | [ai.google.dev](https://ai.google.dev/) (free) |
| PEXELS_API_KEY | Stock photos for landing pages and PDFs | [pexels.com/api](https://www.pexels.com/api/) (free) |
| FIRECRAWL_API_KEY | Clone any webpage as a starting point | [firecrawl.dev](https://www.firecrawl.dev/) |

Everything works without these keys — they just make your assets look better.

Your `.env` file is already protected by `.gitignore`, so your keys will never be uploaded to GitHub.
